2-Dimensional Trajectory Planning for a CNC Machine Tool

This code performs cubic spline interpolation on a set of control points to obtain a fan-shaped
path and determines the corresponding trajectory dynamics for a jerk-limited continuous feed
profile.

The results are shown in the results.png image.
